The aim of this study is to assess the long-term outcomes of prostate cancer patients managed with non-curative intent therapies in different disease risk profiles. The impact of life expectancy and comorbidities on the risk of recurrence and disease-free and overall survival will be assessed. 

This study is undertaken by the joint prostate cancer studyathon of the [IMI PIONEER](https://prostate-pioneer.eu) project, the [IMI EHDEN](https://www.ehden.eu) project and the [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) community (see [announcement](https://prostate-pioneer.eu/uncovering-the-natural-history-of-prostate-cancer-in-data-from-millions-of-patient-across-the-globe)).
